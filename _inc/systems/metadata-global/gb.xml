      <systemDescription>The Game Boy is an 8-bit handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan on April 21, 1989, in North America later the same year, and in Europe in late 1990. It was designed by the same team that developed the Game &amp; Watch series of handheld electronic games and several Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Satoru Okada, Gunpei Yokoi, and Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1.

It was the first handheld game to use video game cartridges since Milton Bradley's Microvision handheld console. Despite many other, technologically superior handheld consoles introduced during its lifetime, the Game Boy was a tremendous success. The Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined have sold 118 million units worldwide. Upon its release in the United States, it sold its entire shipment of one million units within weeks.</systemDescription>
