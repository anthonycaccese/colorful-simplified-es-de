# Colorful (Simplified) for ES-DE

This is simplified take on the Colorful theme which was originally created by [viking](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/70421-viking/) & [faeran](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/76940-faeran/)) for Launchbox.

Most artwork was originally created by viking & faeran (_additional artwork credits can be found in the credits section below_). I translated things for the theming engine used by ES-DE. The original version of the Colorful theme for Launchbox can be found [here](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/2081-colorful-bigbox-theme)

### Changes Made

- Translated and rewrote all Launchbox specific aspects to make the theme compatible with ES-DE
- Updated system image names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Created images & color schemes for additional systems supported by ES-DE
- Added support for ES-DE capabilities such as badges
- Embedded the ES-DE [system-metadata](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/system-metadata) repository to power system description, release year and color details

## Additional Notes

### Versions for other ES forks:
* If you use Batocera... then check out the version [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-simplified-es).  The Batocera version has most of the same base features.  It also adds some additional features such as the theming of the menu and the ability to toggle on/off the display of different media elements directly through the menu ui.
